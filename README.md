Go is a good choice for Python and Ruby developers for easier higher concurrency,
trading some flexibility, ambiguousness, or dynamism for better performance & safer code.
Go is more productive and maintainable than Lisp, but for many it's less "fun" 

Goâ€™s structs and pointers are very similar to C, the main difference is that pointer arithmetic is illegal. 

    type Mat4 [16]float32

    type Entity struct {
      Id        uint32
      Transform Mat4
      Mesh      *gfx.Mesh
    }
